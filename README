Installation Requirements:

g++, cython, subversion, boost, latex2html
log4cxx (from apache.org)
Needs adding #include<string.h> to some files which throw errors
and #include <stdio.h> and #include <stdlib.h> to src/examples/cpp/console.cpp
plus ignore failed unit test :)

Could not find MATLAB when installed in home, had to set:
MATLAB_EXTERN_INCLUDE_PATH to <matlab root>/extern/include
MATLAB_LIBRARIES <matlab root>/bin/glnxa64/libmwblas.so

I had to #include <cstddef> in my blas.h in order to make it compile
Ubuntu repository Cython is 0.16 which doesn't work. Needs 0.18 from pip, otherwise you get:
  "C++ classes not allowed as members of an extension type, use a pointer or reference instead"
When using Cython from PyPI, I had to make a symlink to /usr/local/bin/cython at /usr/bin/cython.
