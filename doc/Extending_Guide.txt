Adding a new C++ layer
======================

1. You will need to create my_layer.h and my_layer.cpp first.
   These will go into the 'layers' directory.

   Make sure you follow the signatures of the existing layers.
   Remember to add it to CMakeLists.txt in 'layers' directory so it compiles.

   Add any new matrix operations needed to matrix_operations.h and matrix_operations.cpp
   in the 'matrix' directory.

2. Add your layer to c_layers.pxd in directory 'pylstm/wrapper'.
   If you added any new matrix operations, add them to c_matrix.pxd in 'pylstm/wrapper'.
